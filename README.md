Energy Consumption Forecast towards Net Zero Transition

Quoting from Mc-Kinsey, “We’re in the midst of an energy transition that continues to evolve.”
With the increase in global temperature and climate change, an international program, namely Net Zero Emission, was established. Net Zero 2050 is an ambitious scenario that limits global warming to 1.5 °C through stringent climate policies and innovation, reaching net-zero CO₂ emissions around 2050. One strategy in energy use is to shift the use of energy from fossil energy sources to renewable energy (renewable energy) so that the Energy Mix target emerges, namely by targeting the composition of renewable energy, namely 32% in 2035 and 50% in 2050. This project mainly provides insights into the longer-term trends that will continue to be essential in shaping future energy systems.

As shown in figure above, world energy consumption is increasing. It can be seen that most of the growth in global energy consumption was positive, except in 1980 due to the global recession, 2009 due to the global economic crisis, and 2020 due to COVID-19.

Based on the energy consumption data in 2020, renewable energy composition is only 14%, with the highest composition being hydro, wind, diesel, biofuels, and biomass.
